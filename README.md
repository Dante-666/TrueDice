# TrueDice
A VR app for Dice that takes accelerometer data and simulates shaking action

I got this idea when I was playing a classic Indian dice based game called Ludo with my newphew and niece. They complained about loosing the die more than often. I looked up some apps which were already on PlayStore but didn't find anything that lets you handle the die naturally. I thought this could be done so I chose cocos2dx as the engine since it seemed lightweight and would let me push out good quality app.
